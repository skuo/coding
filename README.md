DB Schema
---------

DB schema is specified in *src/main/sql/inAuth.sql*, which also has the username and password used in building the
coding war.  It is best to use the same credential when creating the schema.  Otherwise, the properties in 
src/main/conf/local need to be changed.

The seed data file is in *src/main/sql/location.sql*.
